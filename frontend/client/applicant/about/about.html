            <h3 class="title">Purpose</h3>
            <p class="content">The Rizal Technological University (RTU), through its Institute of 
                Flexible Learning and Digital Education, recognizes that not all 
                learning takes place within the confines of traditional classroom 
                environments, and there is a pressing need to expand educational 
                pathways for working professionals, mid-career learners, and other 
                deserving individuals whose competencies have been developed through 
                informal, non-formal, or experiential means.<br><br>
                By offering the Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation 
                Program (ETEEAP), which is governed by Commission on Higher Education 
                Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 29, Series of 2021, RTU can promote an inclusive 
                model of education that validates these learners’ prior learning and grants 
                them equitable access to recognized academic credentials. This initiative 
                closely aligns with RTU’s mission to produce socially responsible professionals 
                prepared to meet the diverse demands of both local and global communities, as 
                well as the University’s philosophy of nurturing the creative potential of 
                Filipinos and upholding moral responsibility and sustainable development.<br><br>
                Moreover, it advances RTU’s mandate to deliver specialized, professional, and 
                technology-driven instruction, strengthen partnerships with industry, and 
                foster civic engagement. By implementing ETEEAP in full compliance with CHED 
                regulations, RTU stands as a forward-thinking, inclusive, and future-oriented 
                institution that significantly contributes to the development of human capital 
                and the realization of national educational goals.

        <div class="about-eteeap">
            <h3 class="title">About ETEEAP</h3>
            <p class="content">The ETEEAP is a comprehensive educational assessment program at the tertiary level 
                that recognizes, accredits and gives equivalencies to knowledge, skills, attitudes 
                and values gained by individuals from relevant work. It is implemented through deputized 
                higher education institutions that shall award the appropriate college degree.<br><br>
                Beneficiaries must be Filipinos who are at least high school graduates. They must have 
                worked for at least 5 years in the field or industry related to the academic program they 
                are obtaining an equivalency. They must also be able to show proof of proficiency, capability 
                and thorough knowledge in the field applied for equivalency.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="benefits">
            <h3 class="title">Benefits of ETEEAP</h3>
            <p class="content">There are more than 10 million Filipinos working in almost all countries all over the world. 
                Many of these were not able to complete their college or university degree while some have 
                completed their undergraduate requirements, but as they continue to gain experiences in the 
                field of their employment and have to take up or about to be assigned to supervisory positions, 
                the issue of academic qualifications started to come up.<br><br>
                This requires them to go back to school or to take up additional training and courses to entitle 
                them the needed credits that qualify them to higher job positions and promotions. Most countries 
                and institutions require their employees to reach a certain academic level to be qualified in a 
                job position. However, the experiences they had gained in their workplace throughout the years 
                weigh much more than the qualifications of new graduates on a piece of paper in their hands as 
                their only credentials.<br><br>
                This is the huge gap that needed to be filled up and the ETEEAP has been evolving to solve this problem. 
                Thanks to all the institutions and people who continue to support this program. And many thanks to the 
                Philippine government that spearheaded this system.

        <div class="mechanism">
            <h3 class="title">ETEEAP Mechanism</h3>
            <p class="content">This expedited process is grounded in the recognition of prior learning and achievements. While students 
                in conventional programs must fulfill every curricular requirement through the standard sequence of coursework 
                and assessments, ETEEAP students leverage their verifiable professional experiences, relevant knowledge and
                skills, previous education and training, as well as awards and achievements. These qualifications are 
                systematically assessed and translated into corresponding academic credits through a Credit for Learning 
                from Competencies and Skills (CLCS) mechanism. This approach values and formalizes prior learning, thereby 
                significantly reducing the time and effort needed to earn a recognized academic credential.<br><br>
                CLC is acronym for Classroom Learning Credits. The deputized institutions' Academic Review Board (ARB) or 
                the equivalent determines the candidates' knowledge, skills, prior education, experience, awards and achievements 
                relevant to a course or field under their academic programs which the students wish to enroll.<br><br>
                Consequently, CLC's can potentially be awarded for equivalent classroom, laboratory, or workshops normally taken up 
                by regular students. Transfer credits for courses or subjects completed at other colleges or universities (if 
                available) are also awarded using the ETEEAP. This unique program uses equivalent competency standards, a 
                comprehensive assessment system and combined assessment methodologies to assess the student's experiences 
                previous college level education and experience. Based upon this assessment, qualified students are awarded 
                CLCs, which reduces the in-classroom time required for graduation.
